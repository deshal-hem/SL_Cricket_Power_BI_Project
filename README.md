## Further Information
- This dataset was obatined from howstat.com, and has been directly linked to Power BI

- After importing the data, the data was cleaned and various transformations were performed using Power Query:
    - The opposition team was extracted using the "Text.AfterDelimiter" function
    - Match location (home or away) and opponent difficulty (strong or weak) were added using conditional columns
    - The winner of the match was added using an IF statement
    - Irrelevant columns were removed

- Afterwards, the cleaned and transformed data were loaded into Power BI

- Various DAX measures were then added:
    - Total matches played
    - Total matches won
    - Total matches lost
    - Matches tied/no result
    - Sri Lanka win %

- Finally, the information was presented using various visualizations:
    - The aggregate matches played, won, lost and the overall win % were shown in enlarged cards
    - The SL win % over the years was displayed in a line chart
    - SL's performance versus opponents and the ground wise performance were shown in tables
    - SL's win % by opponent difficulty was shown in a column chart
    - Slicers were added for opponent difficulty, match location and date.
